Now, regarding deploying this app to your own container app in Azure, here are the steps:

Create a Dockerfile:

Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the instructions to build a Docker image for your application.


FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine

COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Build the Docker image:

Open a terminal in the root directory of your project and run the following command to build the Docker image:


docker build -t <your-image-name> .
Replace <your-image-name> with a name for your Docker image. For example, my-app.

Push the Docker image to a container registry:

You need to push the Docker image to a container registry so that Azure Container Apps can access it. You can use Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, or any other container registry.

Azure Container Registry:

If you want to use Azure Container Registry, you need to create one first. You can do this using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.


az acr create --name <your-acr-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --sku Basic
Replace <your-acr-name> with a name for your Azure Container Registry and <your-resource-group> with the name of your resource group.

After the registry is created, you need to log in to it using the Azure CLI.


az acr login --name <your-acr-name>
Then, tag the Docker image with the registry's login server.


docker tag <your-image-name> <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/<your-image-name>
Finally, push the Docker image to the registry.


docker push <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/<your-image-name>
Docker Hub:

If you want to use Docker Hub, you need to log in to your Docker Hub account using the Docker CLI.


docker login
Then, tag the Docker image with your Docker Hub username.


docker tag <your-image-name> <your-dockerhub-username>/<your-image-name>
Finally, push the Docker image to Docker Hub.


docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/<your-image-name>
Create an Azure Container App:

You can create an Azure Container App using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.


az containerapp create --name <your-container-app-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --image <your-image-name> --environment <your-container-app-environment>
Replace <your-container-app-name> with a name for your Azure Container App, <your-resource-group> with the name of your resource group, <your-image-name> with the name of your Docker image (including the registry), and <your-container-app-environment> with the name of your Azure Container Apps environment. If you don't have an environment, you can create one.


az containerapp env create --name <your-container-app-environment> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --location <your-location>
Replace <your-container-app-environment> with a name for your environment, <your-resource-group> with the name of your resource group, and <your-location> with the location where you want to create the environment.

Configure the Azure Container App:

You may need to configure the Azure Container App to expose it to the internet. You can do this by creating an ingress.


az containerapp ingress enable --name <your-container-app-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --target-port 80 --exposed-port 80 --type External
Replace <your-container-app-name> with the name of your Azure Container App, <your-resource-group> with the name of your resource group, and adjust the ports according to your application's needs.
